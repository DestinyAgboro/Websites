						1. Sales Performance Analysis: Uncover sales trends across various product categories, sectors, regions, and timeframes. Highlight the best and
						worst performers.<br />
						2. Customer Insights: Dive into customer segmentation to reveal purchase patterns, preferences by sector, and geographic distribution. Identify
						the sectors contributing most significantly to sales and profitability.<br />
						3. Inventory Optimization: Evaluate inventory management against sales figures to pinpoint production planning mismatches. Propose methods
						to better align production with market demands.<br />
						4. Profitability Analysis: Analyze the profitability across different product categories, taking into account sales revenue and production costs.
						Point out products with high margins and suggest cost reduction strategies.<br />
						5. Market Expansion Opportunities: Analyze sales and customer data to discover new markets for expansion, emphasizing regions and sectors

						Use your data analysis skills to study the pattern of promotion. With this insight, stake holder can understand the important features among available features that can be used to recommend promotion eligibility. This analysis was performed using Python.<br />
						After analysis,only 8.5% have received promotions and I also findout that Staffs who attended training more than 10 times scored below 8 points in performance ,failed to meet targets, and were not promoted, indicating potential ineffectiveness of excessive training.
						Evaluate the effectiveness of training programs and adjust them as necessary to ensure employees can apply the knowledge gained effectively in their roles.Features like Targets met,Previous_Award,Trainingscoreaverage and LastPerformanceScore.This analysis helped the organization promotion rate to 25%
						.More than two machine Learning models were used to predict staff promotion with minimum accuracy of 89%

						Trade-Goals
						is known for its innovative approach to retail and for
						consistently pushing the boundaries of what's possible
						with data. I am to review the performance of the
						company from 2014- 2017 and plan for the future.<br />
						1. Segment Analysis
						You’ll analyze and visualize how does each
						customer segment contributes to sales and
						profit. What insights can you draw from the
						distribution of sales and profit across these
						segments?<br />
						2. Product Category Analysis
						Imagine you’re a detective investigating which
						products are the stars of the show. By diving into
						sales and profit data across various product
						categories and sub-categories, you'll uncover the
						top performers. What patterns do you notice
						about the best-selling categories?<br />
						3. Month-on-Month Profit Analysis
						Think of tracking your fitness progress over
						time. How does the company’s financial health
						fluctuate throughout the year?<br />
						4. Sales by State
						Identify the states with the highest sales. What
						geographic trends can you spot? <br />
						5. Segment by Quantity
						Consider this like inventory day. How do different
						segments vary in terms of product quantity sold?<br />
						6. KPI Cards
						Finally, it’s time to create the report cards for the
						company. You’ll calculate total transactions, total
						discount, total sales, total profit, and total quantity,
						and then create KPI cards to summarize these key
						performance indicators. What overall story do these
						KPIs tell about the company’s performance?<br />
						This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.

						optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven
						decisions.<br />
						Calculate the total revenue, expenses and profit cumulated
						by the hospital over time.<br />
						What is the profit margin generated by the hospital?
						How many Doctors and Patients does the hospital have on
						record?<br />
						What is the trend of revenue generation over the given time
						period?<br />
						Which Specialties yielded the highest and the lowest revenue ?
						How much revenue those each procedure category make in
						this hospital?<br />
						Looking at each procedure in the hospital, what is the total
						revenue, expenses and profit margin and in how many
						transactions was this achieved?<br />
						Who are the top revenue generating doctor in the hospital?<br />
						Who are the top 5 patients that impacted on Revenue generation?<br />
						How many doctors are in each specialty and how many patients
						patronize each of these specialties?<br />
						What is the trend of patients visits to the hospital over time?
						By gender description give a the total no. of Doctors and patients in
