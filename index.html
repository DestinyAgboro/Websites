						Use your data analysis skills to study the pattern of promotion. With this insight, stake holder can understand the important features among available features that can be used to recommend promotion eligibility. This analysis was performed using Python.<br />
						After analysis,only 8.5% have received promotions and I also findout that Staffs who attended training more than 10 times scored below 8 points in performance ,failed to meet targets, and were not promoted, indicating potential ineffectiveness of excessive training.
						Evaluate the effectiveness of training programs and adjust them as necessary to ensure employees can apply the knowledge gained effectively in their roles.Features like Targets met,Previous_Award,Trainingscoreaverage and LastPerformanceScore.This analysis helped the organization promotion rate to 25%
						.More than two machine Learning models were used to predict staff promotion with minimum accuracy of 89%

			DigitalPath Innovations, a leader in digital marketing solutions, seeks to enhance its website's user
experience to improve engagement metrics, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction. The
company has conducted an A/B test over a two-week period, presenting two distinct versions of its
webpage (Version A and Version B) to a randomized group of users. This experiment aims to
identify which webpage version performs better across various user engagement metrics.
DigitalPath Innovations has compiled a detailed dataset capturing user interactions, behaviors,
and responses to each webpage version. This dataset presents a unique opportunity to analyze the
effectiveness of each design, inform future design iterations, and ultimately enhance user
experience based on data-driven insights <br />
You are tasked with using this dataset to perform a comprehensive analysis of user behavior across the two webpage versions, employing
Tableau for visual analytics. The project's objectives include: <br />
			 
			1. Engagement Metrics Analysis: Assess how each webpage version impacts user engagement, as indicated by time spent on the site, pages
			viewed, and actions taken..<br />
			2. Conversion Rate Optimization: Compare the conversion funnel for both versions, analyzing metrics from product views to purchase
			completion.<br />
			3. User Feedback Analysis: Evaluate the correlation between user feedback submission and the webpage version to gauge user
			engagement/satisfaction.<br />
			4. Content Interaction: Investigate the influence of webpage version on content interaction, specifically video watching behavior<br />
		    5. Referral Source Impact: Analyze how different referral sources affect user behavior and preferences for each webpage version.<br /> 
			This analysis was performed using Tableau.

As Serenity Retail continues to grow, we face the
challenge of effectively understanding and
engaging with our diverse customer base.
Currently, we lack a systematic approach to
segmenting our customers based on their
unique characteristics and preferences. This
limits our ability to tailor our marketing efforts
and offerings to different customer segments,
potentially missing out on opportunities for
increased customer satisfaction and profitability.<br />
The company needs to identify distinct customer
segments based on demographics, purchasing
behavior, and psychographics to optimize its
marketing strategies and enhance customer
engagement.<br />
Aim and ObJectives <br />
Develop a market segmentation
strategy to categorize customers
into distinct segments.<br />
Analyze each customer segment
to understand their unique
characteristics and preferences.<br />
Tailor marketing strategies and
offerings to target each
customer segment effectively. <br />
